# graph
A Golang abstraction layer for using DynamoDB as a graph.

This is a work in progress.  The initial goal was to get the concept out on paper.  The next steps are:

- Enabled Graph Traversal via query DSL TBD.
- Enabled `driver` abstraction to enable `graph` to be used on top of other datasources.
- Tests

Ideas and collaboration welcome. 😁
